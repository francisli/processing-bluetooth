================

This is a Bluetooth library for Processing.  It can be used with the free, open 
source Bluecove JSR-082 implementation on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux:

I've tested most recently only on Mac OS X 10.7.2 (Lion) using the latest
available snapshot of Bluecove:

The library was originally written by Francis Li for
the Mobile Processing project (Processing for Java Micro Edition devices):

Then, it was adapted for Processing by extrapixel:

And is now being modified again by Francis Li, with this latest release adding
support for Bluetooth Object Push Protocol.
